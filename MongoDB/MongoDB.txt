Since MongoDB has a 16 MB file size limit, It would be impossible to store large files of videos and Images directly to MongoDB database, instead we will use the MongoDB API GridFs. 

How does GridFS work? 

1-GridFs breaks up the file into smaller more manageable chunks.

2-Store these chunks of data in one collection called “fs.chucnks”. 

3-stores the information about the whole file itself in another collection called “fs.files.” 

4-connects these documents by properties that are references to each other.

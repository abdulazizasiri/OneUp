
Hi, OneUp team ----

Very nice work on this Preliminary SDD!

A couple of things I noticed:
1) the last paragraph in Section 6.1.1 seems to end in the mid
   dle of a word....  :)
2) is the figure in Section 6.2.1 a "use case" diagram?  If so, it needs a
   bit of work.  If not, it is a good flow of the system so it's OK as-is.
3) There are a couple of typo/formatting things in Section 6.2.2.2.
4) Same paragraph, what is "Ajaj"?  typo?
5) only see one diagram; should be a couple more....

Fix these items in the next release for full credit on the document.

You have 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.

Regards,
Prof. Johnson

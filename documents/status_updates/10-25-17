This week we have continued with our front-end development and have a majority of our components done. We are beginning to route things together with react-routing.

Next week we will finish our front-end (for the most part) and cotninue on to the backend using Node.js and MongoDB. This next week will consists mainly of learning these two things before diving in and applying them to our project.

Challenges/Questions: Node.js and Mongo will definitely be a challenge and we will have questions about them soon enough.

This past week we have finished our components and have learned more about Node.js and MongoDB. We have done a couple practice applications using Node and getting familiar with it. We have reached out to other resources for further guidance through the next phase of the backend.

This next week we will get started with Node.js and designing our databse in MongoDB. We will also tie up some loose knots in our front end.

Questions/Challenges: Have been asking professors, parents, resources for some guidance already. No big roadblocks as of now.

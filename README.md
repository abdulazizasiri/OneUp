# OneUp

Software Engineering project for CMSI 401 Fall 2017

OneUp is a web application that aims to expose young skateboard talent through crowdsource curation. The app will essentially be a video database of user uploaded skate clips that are curated by upvotes and downvotes from other users. OneUp aims to create a space where skaters can surface up democratically, powered by those who know and love skating. Skaters are constantly aiming to get sponsored while building their personal brand, and Oneup can make this process more efficient. Besides serving the committed skater, anyone who simply enjoys watching skate videos will have a place to watch the top clips and have a say in which video/skater should be noticed. 

We believe OneUp will allow skaters to continue pursuing their passion and can possibly change the current form of skateboard media.
